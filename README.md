## [Backend](backend)

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) REST API hosted on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), using [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) for compute and a [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) database.

## [Frontend](frontend)

iOS client written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) using [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit), [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), [Hero](https://github.com/HeroTransitions/Hero), [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher), and [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts)!

**NOTE:** This project uses public data provided by the [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/), consisting of both anonymized and non-anonymized datapoints. Due to the small size of the datasets provided, and overlapping information, parts of the project reveal information about members of the lab that was intended to be anonymous (see: [relevant statistics](https://github.com/jaismith/DALI_Network_19F/tree/jai/frontend#members)). This functionality was not removed in this version of the app, for the purposes of demonstration, but would be if intended for the general public.
